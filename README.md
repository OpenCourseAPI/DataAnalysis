pip install pipenv
# OR

```

Clone [LiveMyPortalData](https://github.com/OpenCourseAPI/LiveMyPortalData.git) and this repo, and install its dependencies:

mkdir opencourse
cd opencourse

git clone https://github.com/OpenCourseAPI/LiveMyPortalData.git

cd DataAnalysis
pipenv install # this may take some time
```

> Note: it is recommended to create a folder such as `opencourse` and clone these repos in that folder, for better organization and usability of the repos.
